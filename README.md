# asana

basics: 
- view schedule
  - list view with sort
  - calendar view.. maybe not necessary?
- add an item
  - name
  - duration, optional
  - category (user specified)
- mark activities done in a satisfying way
- big tally since beginning of time 
  - switch between hours / # activities

harder: 
- autogenerate items on a schedule
  - drag to complete like trello


TODO

- if getTime delta is negative then error if you try to mark complete, can't complete in future
(makes filtering logic easier)
- nest data under user object
